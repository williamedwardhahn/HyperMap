# Microdot Python GUI

Microdot is a minimal, lightweight library for building web interfaces in Python. It utilizes the concept of HTTP routing to handle requests and deliver responses to create a dynamic, interactive user interface. This library can be extremely useful for creating a simple control system with a GUI, especially when used in conjunction with other libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

This example code uses Microdot to create a GUI for controlling a simulated microscopy system. The application allows users to toggle the state of various components, adjust system parameters, and view images captured by the microscope.

## Installation
You can install Microdot via pip:
```bash
pip install microdot
```
For this example, you will also need to install pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib pillow
```

## Code Explanation

The general concept of this code is to provide a web-based interface for a hypothetical microscopy system. The system's state is stored in a pandas DataFrame and saved to a CSV file. The interface allows the user to toggle the state of various components of the system, view an image captured by the system, and navigate through the images.

The Microdot library is used to define HTTP routes that correspond to different actions the user can take. Each route is associated with a Python function, which is executed when the corresponding HTTP request is received.

Here are some examples of the routes and their corresponding functions:

- `'/'`: Displays the control panel for the microscopy system. This is accomplished by returning an HTML document generated by the `generate_html_doc` function.

- `'/image'`: Returns the current image from the microscope. This image is selected from the `image_data` array based on the current image index stored in the system state. The image is then converted to a PNG format and returned as the HTTP response.

- `'/next_image'`: Increments the current image index in the system state and returns the updated control panel. If the index exceeds the number of images, it wraps back to the first image.

- `'/toggle/<component>'`: Toggles the state of a specified component between 'ON' and 'OFF' and returns the updated control panel.

- `'/set_parameter/<parameter>/<value>'`: Sets the value of a specified system parameter and returns the updated control panel.

## Running the Code

To run the code, you simply need to execute the Python script. This will start the Microdot server and the web interface will be accessible at `http://localhost:8008`. If the CSV file storing the system state does not already exist, it will be created when the script is run. 

## Extending the Code

This code can be easily extended to include more features. For example, you could add more routes to handle additional actions, or modify the HTML document to create a more complex user interface. You could also integrate this code with a real hardware system by replacing the simulated state changes and image generation with actual control and data acquisition code.

## Notes

This example uses asynchronous programming concepts, which are essential for building efficient web applications. However, it's important to note that the Microdot library itself is not fully asynchronous. Therefore, while this example uses the Microdot library for simplicity, you might want to consider using a fully asynchronous web framework like FastAPI or Starlette for more complex applications.
